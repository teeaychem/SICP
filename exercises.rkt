; With applicative-order, start by evaluating test.
; test is an if statement, so the predicate is evaluated.
; The predicate contains x, so x is evaluated.
; 0 = 0, so test returns 0.
; y / (p) is not evaluated.

; With normal-order evluation, start by evaluating test, 0, and (p)
; Here, when working through test (p) is substituted in for y.
; And, as (p) is a process, it's evaluated.
; So, with normal-order, this procedure should fail to terminate.

; Key point here is procedure is evaluated first.
; In turn, whatever procedure is obtained from this determines which arguments to evaluate.

; So, here, first checking whether x or y are 0 would lead to a different result, e.g.
(define (test2 x y)
  (if (or (x = 0) (y = 0)) 0
      (if (= x 0)
          0
          y)))
; Nothing really changes on good values. If 0 is 0, 0 is returned, else, if 0 is not 0 y is returned,
; but y is already known to be 0.
; Still, in contrast to test we've not got to evaluate y on the first test.

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause))
  )

; Is the else-clause evaluated?
; For, AOE could be read as saying arguments are only evaluated when applied, and with new-if
; it's not clear else-clause is ever *applied*, it's only returned.
; And, this should be the case, right.
; For, in some cases you can return a procedure, and this wouldn't be possible if you need to
; evaluate before returning.

; Consider:
; (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
;	((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
; Here, + and - aren't evaluated after the predicate.

; But, is it the case that any procedure is automatically evaluated?
; I mean, you don't need to call eval explicitly at the top level.

; I think this is it.
; Any procedure is automatically evaluated.
; However, as sqrt-iter is recursive, a new instance of sqrt-iter
; is made before any evaluation takes place.
; Can see this with rTest

; (define (rTest x)
; 	(new-if (> 1 x) 0 (rTest (- x 1)))
; 	)
; (rTest 2)

; This should terminate fast, but it doesn't.

; By contrast, with a call to if, the two options are explicitly
; evaluated. So, in a recursive case, as long as the function calls
; a conditional which triggers a base case, there's the possibility of
; stopping the recursion before it's triggered again.

; If this is right, it seems a little subtle for the sixth question...

good-enough? checks to see whether abs(guess^2 - target) < 0.001

In the case of small numbers, this not very effective and for large number inadequate.
As good-enough? compares two squared numbers, for small values there won't be much of a difference, while for large number there will be a significant difference.

Observe, squares increaes fast with magnitude.

(- (square 0.5) (square 0.25))
(- (square 5) (square 2.5))
(- (square 50) (square 25))

So, with very small numbers, it's harder to get a difference less than 0.001, while for very large numbers it's fairly easy.
This means, more precision is needed to get below the threshold in the
small case, where the resulting difference isn't going to be noticable.
And, less precision is needed in the large case.
|#

(define (sqrt2 x) (sqrtItr2 1.0 0.0 x))

(define (sqrtItr2 guess previousGuess x)
  (if (goodEnough2? guess previousGuess)
      guess
      (sqrtItr2 (improve guess x) guess x)
      )
  )

; Mostly the same but for goodEnough2.
(define (goodEnough2? guess previousGuess)
  (< (abs (- guess previousGuess)) 0.001))
#|
This, then, works as a limit on the number of significant digits we care about.
Alternatively, can apply to (square guess) (square previousGuess), etc.
Then, it's significant digits of the squared number, rather than root.
|#

(define (improve guess x) (average guess (/ x guess)))
(define (average x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))

#|
Things are now reversed.
For small numbers, things are less accurate, as the sqrt of a small number is going to be small,
and we'll make smaller and smaller changes by taking the average.

It's clear the goal is to show
(phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5) = (phi^(n-1) - psi^(n-1))/sqrt(5) + (phi^(n-2) - psi^(n-2))/sqrt(5)
And, it's easy to go the case of 0 and 1 by hand for regular induction.
But, the induction case... no good idea.

Looking things up, I was going to be lost for a while...
Still, I should remember golden ratio is only positive solution to x + 1 = x^2.
And, phi as given is the golden ratio.
So, phi^(n-2) + phi^(n-1) = phi^(n-2)(phi + 1) = phi^(n-2)phi^2 = phi^n.
This hint might have been enough, as after noticing this with phi, it would be natural to to see
if a similar thing holds for psi.
If only I'd looked back to see that the equation was highlighted...

Steps: Theta(2^n)
Space: Theta(n)

count-change works in a very similar way to tree-recursive fibonacci.
For each call of the alogorithm, at most two calls are made.
One call reduces the amount by at least one.
The other changes the coin of interest.
So, we're asked about a function of the amount, but we can view this as a function of
amount + coins, as coins is constant.
Each call reduces amounts + coins by at least one.
So, after one call we have at most n - 1 calls remaining.
Each of these takes a constant number of steps.
We're doing some tests and then performing summation on the results of the two calls.

For space, I'm following the reasoning on p. 38--9.
We only need to keep track of where to return to.
The algorithm is set to brach n times.
So, the depth of the tree is n.
After each call, the number of leaves doubles.
That is, leaves is given by 2(n-1).
Hence, in total the leaves count to 4(n-1).

To be honest, I think this question is asking the reader to recall p. 39.
The number of steps required by a tree-recursive process will be proportional to the number
of nodes in the tree, while the space required will be proportional to the maximum depth.

For space, important thing to keep in mind is this is max space at any given point in time.
We only need to store a reference to the originial call when starting a new call.
So, in general this will use as much space as calls.
But, at any given time only a certain number of nodes will be in play.
In particular, the height of the tree.
For, there's no need (nor way) to explore multiple nodes at the same time.
|#


;; Ex. 1.15

#|
a.

How many times is p applied?
sine is recursive, and evaluated on every call to sine, but need the result of the recursive call
to be applied.
So, we need to check how many times the recursive call is made before the base case is hit.
12.5/3^5 < 0.1.
So, after 5 additional calls the if condition is true.
p is not applied on the sixth call, but is applied on the 5 other calls.
|#


#|
b.

Theta(n) for both steps and space.

Steps, as we've got a test and then possible single recursive call.
There's no way to bound this call, and the other steps take constant(ish) time.
So, n.

Space, as the recursive call returns, need to keep track of the original call.
This is some constant(ish) space for each maximum call depth, which is roughly n.

Right, this is a linear recursive process.

The main operator of gcd is a conditional, and as described the condition of a conditional is
evaluated before either result is evaluated.
So, the remainder operations actually performed equal the number of times gcd is called, minus one.
For, on the last call (= b 0), which goes to a.

Or I'm missing something, but it seems the conditional must work in this way.
Normal order reduces everything to a primitive form.
But, with a recursive function like gcd a 'synthetic' primative form is needed.
For, otherwise, and additional call to gcd is always possible.

With all this in mind, given the flow is determined by a conditional, normal and evaluative order should be the same here.

Again, timing isn't particularly easy here.
I'd expect 1,000,000 to not take too much more time than 1000, as we have Theta(long n) growth.
|#


;; Ex. 1.25


#|
With expmod we have a way of figuring out the exponential of a number modulo another number (with Theta(log n) growth).
So, roughly remainder(base^exp / m).
The way this works is to figure out base^exp and then task the remainder at each call.
Difference is where remainder is called.
As given, we take remainder before squaring resut, in the even case.
So, this should make a differnece, at least in principle.
As, both remainder and square take time, and depending on the way things go, could lead to m long n growth.
But, presumably as the argument is kept small, this growth is 'hidden' behind the growth of the exponent.

As footnote 46 points out, the position of remainder ensures the numbers dealt with are not much larger than m.

By contrast, for the proposed expmod, we for sure need to consider the growth of remainder.
If it's n, then we have n + long n = n.

Though, I can't find much about the cost of remainder in the text.
|#



;; Ex. 1.26


#|
With explicit multiplication, there are now two calls to expmod on each recursive call.
So, we've effectively doubled the amount of work. (log n)^2 = n.

With square, by contrast, the result of expmod is evaluated and then passed to the fuction.
The evaluated value is used twice, but the evaluation only happens once.

Modifying expmod to signal whether it discovers a non-trivial square root of 1.

An important detail was a little buried.
For, the test is only guaranteed for odd numbers.
So, when working through half of the numbers, we need to already be sure the number is odd.

Added some formatting, though ofc I should have a single call for n/prime display.

Here, just constructing a function.
There's two options.
First (as taken), define the general function, and then obtain a particular instance.
Second, directly define a particular instance (as commented).

  (lambda (x) (f (f x)))

#|
This is a little surprising.
For, the most natural base case is f x.
With this, completing recursive calls gets f^n x.
And, as a last step take Î» x f^n x, or just leave the procedure as it is.

But, this isn't okay, as x dones't evaluate to anything.

So, instead, the base case is f.
The argument is not made explicit, so there's no issue of evaluting it.
We just return the procedure.

So, mabye it's not *that* strange.
With f x we are working with some arbitrary value, and as this is arbitrary, what we're doing is transformed into a procedure.
And, with f we are working with a procedure directly.

Hm.

(define (smoothed f dx)

    )
  )


(define (smooth-fold f dx n)
  ((repeated (lambda (x) (smoothed x dx)) n) f)
  )



#|
Nothing too exciting here.
We repeat the smoothing, and then apply this to the function.
(Repeating smoothing applied to the function would involve repeating the function.)
lambda lets us do this easily, though I guess it would also be easy if dx was fixed as a constant somewhere.

Average-damp(f(x)) = (x + f(x))/2

e.g. Average-damp(10^2) = 55 = (10 + 100)/2

In general, fixed point fails without dampening as y -> x/y -> x/(x/y) -> y
Then, y -> (x + x/y)/2.

In any case, this exercise seems rough.
We're asked to experiment to find out how many average damps are required to compute nth roots as a fixed-point search.
The problem is failure to converge, though.
Of course, things are a little better.
For, the general form of the problem is re-obtaining the initial value, or at least a prior value.
So, it's in principle possible to store every value computed and then check to see if any of these are repeated.
Still, it's not very interesting.

The final function isn't too interesting either.
Once the required number of times to average damp is figured out, the next task is to repeatedly average damp the function, and then apply the fixed point solver to this.

Though, I think this should be a little more general.
With a coordinate space, there's no limit on the dimension.
So, rather than having distinct x and y selectors, there should be a general selection which takes the dimension as an argument.

The representation of the rectangle doesn't matter, so long as there's selectors for origin, width, and height.

And, I can't think of an interesting alterantive representation.
Could take the center point.
The only thing here is origin is given by center.x - width/2, etc.

Could also take two points.
Say, top left and bottom right.
Then, origin is top left, and width is obtained from top right.x - bottom left.x in the positive case.

To pair the numbers use any exponentiation procedure which takes base and exponent arguments.

To break apart the number, keep dividing by either 2 or 3 until no further integer division is possible.

I'd guess there's some trick with log here, but I don't see it quickly.

Okay, not allowed to apply repeat to add-1.

Still, this is just a variation on add-1.

(define (add n m)
(lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f (n f) ((m f) x)))))

Instead of x, we have ((m f) x).
m is of the form Î»f Î»x f^m x.
So, ((m f) x) is of the form f^m x.
n is of the form Î»f Î»x f^n x
So, (n f) is of the form Î»x f^m x.
Hence, (f (n f) ((m f) x)) reduces to f^n (f^m x).
And, this is what we want. f applied n + m times.

;; 2.1.4 Extended exercise


#|
Why not do intervals by a precise quantity tolerance pair?
At least in the case of resistors, where things are specified this way?

Though, I can see in general specifying lower and upper bounds is easier.
Unless, upper + lower / 2.
This gets 'precise quantity'.
Then, upper - mid.
This gets half width.
So, either way seems fine.
|#


;; 2.7

(define (make-interval a b) (cons a b))

So, add-interval reduces to addition on the upper and lower bounds.
In this way, sub-interval will do the same.
Though, add a check to ensure upper is upper and lower is lower.
|#

(define (add-interval x y)
  (make-interval (+ (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y))
                 (+ (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y))
                 ))

(define (sub-interval x y)
  (let (
        (lIS (- (lower-bound x) (lower-bound y)))
        (hIS (- (upper-bound x) (upper-bound y)))
        )
    (if (> hIS lIS)
        (make-interval hIS lIS)
        (make-interval lIS hIS)
        )
    ))

(add-interval (make-interval 0 1) (make-interval 9 10))
(sub-interval (make-interval 0 2) (make-interval 9 10))

In the same way adding increases margin, subtancting decreases margin.
I feel this isn't quite right.
Instead, go with proposal above and take an procedure for combining two tolerances.

In the case of addition.
x.w + y.w = (x.u - x.l)/2 + (y.u - y.l)/2
          = ((x.u - x.l) + (y.u - y.l))/2
          = ((x.u + y.u) + (x.l - y.l))/2
          = (x + y).w

The reasoning is the same for subtraction.
|#


#|
For multiplication, consider some intervals using 0 and 1.
(1 0) * (1 0) = (0 0)
And, we have (1 0).w = 0.5, while (0 0).w = 0.
In contrast:
(1 1) * (1 1) = (1 1)
And, we have (1 1).w = 0.5

Division isâ€¦ defined in terms of multiplication as the main operator.
This isn't a proof, but suggests similar problems.

'spans 0' means 'has width 0'?

I'm not quite seeing the point of this exercise.
In any case, we can write out a table of all the possible positive/negative combinations.
Then, we can work out whether there's a guaranteed value for the upper and lower bounds.
With perhaps some errors, I have this:

 u_x | u_y | l_x | l_y | ub | lb
  +  |  +  |  +  |  +  | P4 | P1
  +  |  +  |  +  |  -  | P4 | P3
  +  |  +  |  -  |  +  | P4 | P2
  +  |  +  |  -  |  -  |
  +  |  -  |  +  |  +  | P3 | P4
  +  |  -  |  +  |  -  | P2 | P3
  +  |  -  |  -  |  +  |
  +  |  -  |  -  |  -  | P1 | P3
  -  |  +  |  +  |  +  | P2 | P3
  -  |  +  |  +  |  -  |
  -  |  +  |  -  |  +  | P1 | P4
  -  |  +  |  -  |  -  | P1 | P2
  -  |  -  |  +  |  +  |
  -  |  -  |  +  |  -  | P3 | P1
  -  |  -  |  -  |  +  | P4 | P1
  -  |  -  |  -  |  -  | P1 | P4

Where:

P1 l_x l_y
P2 l_x u_y
P3 u_x l_y
P4 u_x u_y

Here, then, there's the 'else' case, which covers the four instances where we need to calculate more than two combinations.
In all the other cases, we need to calculate the listed two cases.

But, I guess I've got this a little wrong.
For, we can break this down into sets of calculations.
I.e. { P1, P4 } covers both the last and the first case.
Then, for the upper and lower bound we only need to figure out which is larger than the other.
This is still only two instances of multiplications.

But, on my count there are six distinct sets.
So, this means we only need to consider seven cases.

I guess I'm missing something hereâ€¦

Ah, I guess I'm this potential user, huh.

;; Ex. 2.12

(define (make-center-width c w)
  (make-interval (- c w) (+ c w))
  )

(define (make-center-percent c p)
  (let ((nudge (* (abs c) p)))
    (make-interval (- c nudge) (+ c nudge))
    )
  )

(define (i-center i)
  (/ (+ (lower-bound i) (upper-bound i)) 2)
  )

#|
This isn't super precise with small percentages.
But, there's no way around this without changing the bound constructor.
As, imprecision has already entered by multiplying the center by the percentage to get the bounds.
|#
(define (i-percent i)
  (- (/ (upper-bound i) (i-center i)) 1)
  )


(i-center (make-center-percent 10 0.001))
(i-percent (make-center-percent 10 1.01))


;; Ex 2.13


#|
Assuming small percentage tolerances and all numbers are positive.

Formula for the approximate percentage tolerance of the product of two intervals
in terms of the tolerances of the factors.
|#


#|
So, for the product we take min/max of different upper/lower x/y combinations.
In general, then, product is of the form:

(x Â± t_x) * (y Â± t_y) = (xy Â± yt_x Â± xt_y Â± t_xt_y)
|#


#|
Hm, well, to find the tolerance pertentage, divide upper by center then subtract 1.
Ignoring the part where we substract one, we have:
u / ((u + l) / 2) = 2u/(u * l)

If assuming everything is positive, then upper and lower bounds are direct.

So, we have

2(ux + tx)(uy + ty) / ((ux + tx)(uy + ty) + (lx + tx)(ly + ty))

Where tx is really uxtx, etc.
That is, ux + tx = ux(1 + tx).


Different way of looking at things.
If we start by keeping tolerance in play, then the upper bound for x, with tolerance is u_x(1 * tx).
So, then, the upper bound for product, with tolerance is
u_x * u_y * (1 * tx) * (1 * ty)
So, then, (1 * tx) * (1 * ty) = 1 + tx + ty + txty.
In this case, then, why not take the tolerance as tx + ty + txty?
This seems sufficiently simple, but gives the exactl toleranceâ€¦
Of course, tx + ty should get quite close when tx and ty are very small, as txty is going to be very very small.

  (let ((one (make-interval 1 1)))
    (div-interval one
                  (add-interval (div-interval one r1)
                                (div-interval one r2)))))

(define ti2 (make-center-width 2 0.001))
(define ti3 (make-center-width 4 0.001))

#|
Two intervals are equal just in case they have the same upper and lower bounds.
|#
(define (i-equal i1 i2)
  (and (= (upper-bound i1) (upper-bound i2)) (= (lower-bound i1) (lower-bound i2)))
  )

(par1 ti1 ti2)
(par2 ti1 ti2)
(i-equal (par1 ti1 ti2) (par2 ti1 ti2))

(i-percent (par1 ti1 ti2))
(i-percent (par2 ti1 ti2))


;; Ex. 2.15


#|
So, as intervals are just upper and lower bounds, the tolerance percentage is implicit.

When adding, everything should be preserved.
For, we sum the lower and upper bounds.
So, the center point of the new point is just the sum of the center points of the initial points.

Similar for subtraction.

In this sense, Eva Lu Ator isn't quite right.
The operations performed are important, not just the way the interval is written.
|#


#|
Things are different in the case of product and division, though.
Here we multiply bounds, and hence multiply tolerance.
As seen earlier, we get (1 * tx) * (1 * ty) = 1 + tx + ty + txty.

par2 has one less instance of multiplication than par1.
And, as x * y > x + y, at least when everything is positive, at least some of the additional tolerance from product is going to be preserved.

Going to need to define "better", tho.
It's not clear tolerance as given really reflects anything under these transformations.
|#


;; Ex. 2.16


#|
Well, par1 and par2 are the same when i1 and i2 are rational numbers, at least.
So, when addition, multiplication, etc. satisfy certain properties.
It's not clear these same properties are satisfied when working with intervals.

The answer here really depends on what is allowed with the package.
If mul and div are fixed, there's no way out.
Equivalent expressions using rationals won't translate to intervals.
Assuming, that is, something is different.

But really, the issue is this.
Resistor values are only know up to some tolerance.
These formulas are defined with respect to resistor values without accounting for tolerance.
It's a mistake to think operations on fixed values apply equally to intervals or whatever.

With lists like this, there's a tradeoff between easy read and easy write.
And, as set up, it's easy read.
For, it's easy to go from the right element to the last.
It's not easy write, though, as you need to traverse through every element until you get to the end.

Though, you'd expect this to be the case in general.
We need to keep track of things, and the easy-write probably changes more than the easy to read thing.

The order of the coin list doesn't matter.
For, we always try to make the value using with and without the current 'first' coin.
So, if, say, 50 is up first, the first call will split into using 50 and ignoring 50.
While, if 50 is up somewhere in the middle, this split will happen multiple times, according to the splits that have already happened.

I understand this way of writing procedures is useful.
Still, the application here seems strange.
same-parity feels like a regular procedure, which  takes some int and a list as an argument and returns a list.
Though, maybe I could think about this from a difference perspective.
At issue is the list is not explicit, but the same is true of +.
And in some sense the list is explicit, it's just that the first element is a procedure to apply.
And, kind of everything is a list in this way.
So, there's no need to make a list which contains a procedure and a list when we can just extend the list we'd be adding with the procedure.
Ok.
