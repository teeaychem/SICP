cons as a two place operator seems odd.
Esp. given + takes an arbirary number of places.
Though, I can see this in terms of a linked list.
Where, car and cdr are value and point (or vice-versa).
Still, as far as the textbook goes, starting with the abstraction of lists and then seeing the implementation is what I expected.
