Exercises and notes from working through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/) (SICP).

I am using [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/index.html) with [#lang sicp](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/SICP_Language.html).

Work is typed up in a .org file which github renders nicely.

So, you can check exercises.org above, or click [here](/exercises.org)!

## Background

I'm using a print edition of SICP, but an online version is available here: [http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).

The choice to use Racket was made after reading the [SICP-guile](https://github.com/zv/SICP-guile) guide.

## A few notes

Exercises aren't checked against any other source unless noted (no notes so far).

Some exercises are (perhaps partially) deferred to another time. A reason is usually given.

The results of executing a block of code are hidden by the .org renderer on github.
Still, starting around chapter 3 most of the results are viewable by inspecting the raw file.
