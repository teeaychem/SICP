# In this repository…

Exercises and notes from working through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/) (SCIP) using [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/index.html) with [#lang sicp](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/SICP_Language.html).

Work is typed up in a .org file which github renders quite nicely.

So, you can check exercises.org above, or click [here](/exercises.org)!

## A little more…

I'm using a print edition of SCIP, but an online version is available here: [http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).
Choice to use Racket was made after reading the [SICP-guile](https://github.com/zv/SICP-guile) guide.

### A few notes…

Exercises aren't checked against any other source unless noted (no notes so far).

Sometimes tests are left uncommented, sometimes commented, and a lot of the time tests are deleted.

If you search through the commits you'll find at least once instance where a later problem has revealed an earlier problem was wonky.
