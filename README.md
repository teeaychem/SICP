# In this repository…

Exercises and notes from working through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/) (SCIP) using [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/index.html) with [#lang sicp](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/SICP_Language.html).

## A little more…

I'm using a print edition of SCIP, but an online version is available here: [http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).
Choice to use Racket was made after reading the [SICP-guile](https://github.com/zv/SICP-guile) guide.

### A few notes…

Exercises are unchecked unless noted.

If you search through the commits you'll find at least once instance where a later problem has revealed an earlier problem was wonky.
