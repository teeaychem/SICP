Exercises and notes from working through [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/) (SICP).

I'm using [Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/index.html) with [#lang sicp](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/SICP_Language.html).

Work is typed up in a .org file which github renders well.

You can check exercises.org above, or click [here](/exercises.org)!

## Background

I'm using a print edition of SICP, but an online version is available here: [http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/](http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/).

The choice to use Racket was made after reading the [SICP-guile](https://github.com/zv/SICP-guile) guide.

## A few notes

Most exercises can be self-checked to a fair level of confidence.
So, if it's possible to do some verification, it has been done.
And, if not, I'm at least fairly confident things are correct.

(The results of executing a block of code are hidden by the .org renderer on github.
Still, starting around chapter 3 most of the results are viewable by inspecting the raw file.)

Some exercises are (perhaps partially) deferred to another time. 
A reason is usually given.

The last few exercises are on hold while I bursh up on C. I hope to return to them at some point!
