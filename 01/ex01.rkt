; With applicative-order, start by evaluating test.
; test is an if statement, so the predicate is evaluated.
; The predicate contains x, so x is evaluated.
; 0 = 0, so test returns 0.
; y / (p) is not evaluated.

; With normal-order evluation, start by evaluating test, 0, and (p)
; Here, when working through test (p) is substituted in for y.
; And, as (p) is a process, it's evaluated.
; So, with normal-order, this procedure should fail to terminate.

; Key point here is procedure is evaluated first.
; In turn, whatever procedure is obtained from this determines which arguments to evaluate.

; So, here, first checking whether x or y are 0 would lead to a different result, e.g.
(define (test2 x y)
  (if (or (x = 0) (y = 0)) 0
      (if (= x 0)
          0
          y)))
; Nothing really changes on good values. If 0 is 0, 0 is returned, else, if 0 is not 0 y is returned,
; but y is already known to be 0.
; Still, in contrast to test we've not got to evaluate y on the first test.

(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause))
  )

; Is the else-clause evaluated?
; For, AOE could be read as saying arguments are only evaluated when applied, and with new-if
; it's not clear else-clause is ever *applied*, it's only returned.
; And, this should be the case, right.
; For, in some cases you can return a procedure, and this wouldn't be possible if you need to
; evaluate before returning.

; Consider:
; (define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
;	((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
; Here, + and - aren't evaluated after the predicate.

; But, is it the case that any procedure is automatically evaluated?
; I mean, you don't need to call eval explicitly at the top level.

; I think this is it.
; Any procedure is automatically evaluated.
; However, as sqrt-iter is recursive, a new instance of sqrt-iter
; is made before any evaluation takes place.
; Can see this with rTest

; (define (rTest x)
; 	(new-if (> 1 x) 0 (rTest (- x 1)))
; 	)
; (rTest 2)

; This should terminate fast, but it doesn't.

; By contrast, with a call to if, the two options are explicitly
; evaluated. So, in a recursive case, as long as the function calls
; a conditional which triggers a base case, there's the possibility of
; stopping the recursion before it's triggered again.

; If this is right, it seems a little subtle for the sixth question...

good-enough? checks to see whether abs(guess^2 - target) < 0.001

In the case of small numbers, this not very effective and for large number inadequate.
As good-enough? compares two squared numbers, for small values there won't be much of a difference, while for large number there will be a significant difference.

Observe, squares increaes fast with magnitude.

(- (square 0.5) (square 0.25))
(- (square 5) (square 2.5))
(- (square 50) (square 25))

So, with very small numbers, it's harder to get a difference less than 0.001, while for very large numbers it's fairly easy.
This means, more precision is needed to get below the threshold in the
small case, where the resulting difference isn't going to be noticable.
And, less precision is needed in the large case.
|#

(define (sqrt2 x) (sqrtItr2 1.0 0.0 x))

(define (sqrtItr2 guess previousGuess x)
  (if (goodEnough2? guess previousGuess)
      guess
      (sqrtItr2 (improve guess x) guess x)
      )
  )

; Mostly the same but for goodEnough2.
(define (goodEnough2? guess previousGuess)
  (< (abs (- guess previousGuess)) 0.001))
#|
This, then, works as a limit on the number of significant digits we care about.
Alternatively, can apply to (square guess) (square previousGuess), etc.
Then, it's significant digits of the squared number, rather than root.
|#

(define (improve guess x) (average guess (/ x guess)))
(define (average x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))

#|
Things are now reversed.
For small numbers, things are less accurate, as the sqrt of a small number is going to be small,
and we'll make smaller and smaller changes by taking the average.

It's clear the goal is to show
(phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5) = (phi^(n-1) - psi^(n-1))/sqrt(5) + (phi^(n-2) - psi^(n-2))/sqrt(5)
And, it's easy to go the case of 0 and 1 by hand for regular induction.
But, the induction case... no good idea.

Looking things up, I was going to be lost for a while...
Still, I should remember golden ratio is only positive solution to x + 1 = x^2.
And, phi as given is the golden ratio.
So, phi^(n-2) + phi^(n-1) = phi^(n-2)(phi + 1) = phi^(n-2)phi^2 = phi^n.
This hint might have been enough, as after noticing this with phi, it would be natural to to see
if a similar thing holds for psi.
If only I'd looked back to see that the equation was highlighted...

Steps: Theta(2^n)
Space: Theta(n)

count-change works in a very similar way to tree-recursive fibonacci.
For each call of the alogorithm, at most two calls are made.
One call reduces the amount by at least one.
The other changes the coin of interest.
So, we're asked about a function of the amount, but we can view this as a function of
amount + coins, as coins is constant.
Each call reduces amounts + coins by at least one.
So, after one call we have at most n - 1 calls remaining.
Each of these takes a constant number of steps.
We're doing some tests and then performing summation on the results of the two calls.

For space, I'm following the reasoning on p. 38--9.
We only need to keep track of where to return to.
The algorithm is set to brach n times.
So, the depth of the tree is n.
After each call, the number of leaves doubles.
That is, leaves is given by 2(n-1).
Hence, in total the leaves count to 4(n-1).

To be honest, I think this question is asking the reader to recall p. 39.
The number of steps required by a tree-recursive process will be proportional to the number
of nodes in the tree, while the space required will be proportional to the maximum depth.

For space, important thing to keep in mind is this is max space at any given point in time.
We only need to store a reference to the originial call when starting a new call.
So, in general this will use as much space as calls.
But, at any given time only a certain number of nodes will be in play.
In particular, the height of the tree.
For, there's no need (nor way) to explore multiple nodes at the same time.
|#


;; Ex. 1.15

#|
a.

How many times is p applied?
sine is recursive, and evaluated on every call to sine, but need the result of the recursive call
to be applied.
So, we need to check how many times the recursive call is made before the base case is hit.
12.5/3^5 < 0.1.
So, after 5 additional calls the if condition is true.
p is not applied on the sixth call, but is applied on the 5 other calls.
|#


#|
b.

Theta(n) for both steps and space.

Steps, as we've got a test and then possible single recursive call.
There's no way to bound this call, and the other steps take constant(ish) time.
So, n.

Space, as the recursive call returns, need to keep track of the original call.
This is some constant(ish) space for each maximum call depth, which is roughly n.

Right, this is a linear recursive process.

The main operator of gcd is a conditional, and as described the condition of a conditional is
evaluated before either result is evaluated.
So, the remainder operations actually performed equal the number of times gcd is called, minus one.
For, on the last call (= b 0), which goes to a.

Or I'm missing something, but it seems the conditional must work in this way.
Normal order reduces everything to a primitive form.
But, with a recursive function like gcd a 'synthetic' primative form is needed.
For, otherwise, and additional call to gcd is always possible.

With all this in mind, given the flow is determined by a conditional, normal and evaluative order should be the same here.

Again, timing isn't particularly easy here.
I'd expect 1,000,000 to not take too much more time than 1000, as we have Theta(long n) growth.
|#


;; Ex. 1.25


#|
With expmod we have a way of figuring out the exponential of a number modulo another number (with Theta(log n) growth).
So, roughly remainder(base^exp / m).
The way this works is to figure out base^exp and then task the remainder at each call.
Difference is where remainder is called.
As given, we take remainder before squaring resut, in the even case.
So, this should make a differnece, at least in principle.
As, both remainder and square take time, and depending on the way things go, could lead to m long n growth.
But, presumably as the argument is kept small, this growth is 'hidden' behind the growth of the exponent.

As footnote 46 points out, the position of remainder ensures the numbers dealt with are not much larger than m.

By contrast, for the proposed expmod, we for sure need to consider the growth of remainder.
If it's n, then we have n + long n = n.

Though, I can't find much about the cost of remainder in the text.

;; Ex. 1.26


#|
With explicit multiplication, there are now two calls to expmod on each recursive call.
So, we've effectively doubled the amount of work. (log n)^2 = n.

With square, by contrast, the result of expmod is evaluated and then passed to the fuction.
The evaluated value is used twice, but the evaluation only happens once.

Modifying expmod to signal whether it discovers a non-trivial square root of 1.

An important detail was a little buried.
For, the test is only guaranteed for odd numbers.
So, when working through half of the numbers, we need to already be sure the number is odd.

Added some formatting, though ofc I should have a single call for n/prime display.

Here, just constructing a function.
There's two options.
First (as taken), define the general function, and then obtain a particular instance.
Second, directly define a particular instance (as commented).

  (lambda (x) (f (f x)))
  )

((double inc) 2)
(((double (double double)) inc) 5)

#|
This is a little surprising.
For, the most natural base case is f x.
With this, completing recursive calls gets f^n x.
And, as a last step take Î» x f^n x, or just leave the procedure as it is.

But, this isn't okay, as x dones't evaluate to anything.

So, instead, the base case is f.
The argument is not made explicit, so there's no issue of evaluting it.
We just return the procedure.

So, mabye it's not *that* strange.
With f x we are working with some arbitrary value, and as this is arbitrary, what we're doing is transformed into a procedure.
And, with f we are working with a procedure directly.

Hm.

(define (smoothed f dx)

    )

(define (smooth-fold f dx n)
  ((repeated (lambda (x) (smoothed x dx)) n) f)
  )



#|
Nothing too exciting here.
We repeat the smoothing, and then apply this to the function.
(Repeating smoothing applied to the function would involve repeating the function.)
lambda lets us do this easily, though I guess it would also be easy if dx was fixed as a constant somewhere.

Average-damp(f(x)) = (x + f(x))/2

e.g. Average-damp(10^2) = 55 = (10 + 100)/2

In general, fixed point fails without dampening as y -> x/y -> x/(x/y) -> y
Then, y -> (x + x/y)/2.

In any case, this exercise seems rough.
We're asked to experiment to find out how many average damps are required to compute nth roots as a fixed-point search.
The problem is failure to converge, though.
Of course, things are a little better.
For, the general form of the problem is re-obtaining the initial value, or at least a prior value.
So, it's in principle possible to store every value computed and then check to see if any of these are repeated.
Still, it's not very interesting.

The final function isn't too interesting either.
Once the required number of times to average damp is figured out, the next task is to repeatedly average damp the function, and then apply the fixed point solver to this.
